## ü§ö Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Depending on your purpose, PaymentSDK provides two options to integrate. If you want to use pre built-in UI that contains payment method list, transaction detail and transaction result, please install `PaymentSDK`. In case you only want to use business functions, please install `PaymentGateway`.

## üçñ  Installation <a name="installation"></a>

Using **[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)**

**Prerequisite**: `FirebaseFirestore` has been installed

```ruby
pod 'FirebaseFirestore'
```

Add binary framework to project **[Release v0.0.1](https://github.com/tungnx-teko/Minerva/releases/tag/0.0.1)**

## üî© Configuration<a name="configuration"></a>

Before using PaymentGateway, we have to set up a `PaymentGatewayConfig`

```swift
let config = PaymentGatewayConfig(
    clientCode, // payment client code, provided by PS
    terminalCode, // payment terminal code, provided by PS
    serviceCode, // payment service code, provided by PS
    secretKey, // payment secret key, provided by PS
    baseUrl // payment service base url
)
```

**Payment api url**

```ruby
Dev: "https://payment.develop.tekoapis.net/api"
Staging: "https://payment.stage.tekoapis.net/api"
Production: "https://payment.tekoapis.com/api"
```

Then we need to init `PaymentGateway` with this config

```swift
PaymentGateway.shared.setUp(config, environment: .development)
```

After that, we can retrieve an instance of `PaymentGateway` by

```swift
let paymentGateway = PaymentGateway.shared
```

Then you have to add a respective config for each payment method you use in your app.

```swift
let cttConfig = CTTPaymentConfig(partnerCode: partnerCode)
try PaymentGateway.addConfig(cttConfig, forMethod: .qr)
```

Finally, add payment methods to the `gateway`

```swift
PaymentGateway.addPaymentMethods([.qr, .spos])
```


## üîë Create Transaction<a name="create-transaction"></a>

`PaymentGateway` provides business functions to create QR code, or create transaction. To do this, we need to create a `PaymentRequest` and pass to `PaymentGateway.pay(paymentMethod, paymentRequest)`

And then, we can use the result of `pay` method to do everything you want.

```swift
let request = CTTTransactionRequest(orderId: orderId,
                                    orderCode: orderCode,
                                    amount: amount, 
                                    expireTime: expireTime)                                     
```

```swift
try paymentGateway.pay(method: .qr, request: request, completion: { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let transaction):
        // Do something
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle error
    }
})  
```

## üîë Observe Transaction Result<a name="observe-transaction"></a>

In the screen where you want to observe the transaction result, you need to create a `PaymentObserver`

```swift
observer.observe(transactionCode: transactionCode) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        // Success, order is paid
    case .failure(let error):
        // Failed
    }
}
```

</p>

We need to create a `PaymentRequest` object and then pass to `PaymentActivity` or `PaymentViewController`.

> **Note:** Even when you use PaymentSDK, it's still needed to set config for PaymentGateway.

```swift
let request = PaymentRequest(orderId: orderId,
                             orderCode: orderCode,
                             orderDescription: orderDescription, // not required
                             amount: 100000,
                             expireTime: 600) // not required, default is 600s
```

```swift
let payment = PaymentRouter.createModule(request: request, 
                                         delegate: self)
present(payment, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Delegate is an object whose class conforms to `PaymentDelegate`. 

> You can either present or push paymentViewController from your navigation. PaymentSDK has itself built-in navigation controller. 

```swift
func onResult(_ result: PaymentResult) {
    
}

func onCancel() {
    
}
```

## üåà Customization<a name="customization"></a>

View theme properties and string values can be access through `PaymentSDK.Theme`.
